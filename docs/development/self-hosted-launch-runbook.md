# Self-hosted launch

Use the same flow for every Freshell machine. An instance is one Rust server
and one native Windows Electron client connected to it.

## Prepare the checkout (once, and after pulling changes)

The server needs the locked dependency tree present before it can start —
the Rust server launches the Claude sidecar from
`crates/freshell-claude-sidecar` at runtime. On a pnpm-era checkout
(development `main`), run the frozen install from the repo root:

```bash
cd /home/dan/code/freshell
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

The root workspace install covers the app plus both workspace members (the
Claude sidecar and the MCP runtime packaging package). The launcher and the
`dev`/`start` script hooks verify sidecar readiness before the server spawns
and, if the tree is missing or stale, repair it with one frozen filtered
install — never a mutable one. An npm-era checkout (for example the v0.7.5
release) prepares with `npm install` instead.

Preparing or refreshing the workspace is a normal build step and needs no
approval. **Restarting the live production server is a different operation and
still requires the user's explicit approval (`APPROVED`).**

## Start or verify the server

Run this on the machine that owns the server:

```bash
cd /home/dan/code/freshell
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/health
```

If the health check fails, start the server with the canonical launcher:

```bash
scripts/launch-rust.sh --port 3001
```

For a remote machine, run the same command through SSH:

```bash
ssh <machine> 'cd /home/dan/code/freshell && scripts/launch-rust.sh --port 3001'
```

The launcher builds as needed, verifies the sidecar tree as part of startup,
and leaves a healthy instance running. Restarting
the live port requires explicit approval (`APPROVED`).

The optional systemd user unit (`installers/systemd/freshell-rust.service`)
launches the Rust binary directly — its `ExecStart` is the
`freshell-server` executable, no package manager involved — so it performs
no dependency preparation; prepare the checkout once on that machine as
above, and the service restores the server after restarts.

## Launch the native Windows client

Run this in a native Windows PowerShell terminal:

```powershell
$exe = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Freshell\Freshell.exe"
$profile = "$env:APPDATA\freshell-<server-id>"
Start-Process -FilePath $exe -ArgumentList "--user-data-dir=$profile"
```

Use a different `<server-id>` for each client whose Electron state should be
separate. The `--user-data-dir` argument selects the Electron/Chromium profile;
it does not select the Freshell server. The current desktop connection target
and token are shared outside that profile in
`%USERPROFILE%\.freshell\desktop.json`. Select or configure the target in
Freshell when prompted and verify that the client connected to the intended
server. Do not put tokens in the launch command.

## Verify the instance

Confirm that:

1. `GET /api/health` returns successfully on the server.
2. The native Windows Freshell window is visible.
3. The client is connected to the intended server, especially when more than
   one server is in use.
