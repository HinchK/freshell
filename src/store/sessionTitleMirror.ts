 * Collect every session row that currently has a title, DEDUPED by
 * `${provider}:${sessionId}`: the same session can sit in several retained
 * windows (e.g. sidebar AND history), and a later refresh of a window does
 * NOT mean its rows are fresh — the deep-page silent refresh RETAINS older
 * rows (sessionsThunks.ts:602-609 merges the fresh page-1 over the stored
 * window; deeper rows survive as the SAME objects, sessionsThunks.ts:184-204)
 * while `commitWindowPayload` stamps the whole merged window with fresh
 * lastLoadedAt/resultVersion (sessionsSlice.ts). So the winner is picked by
 * per-ROW freshness, NOT by window stamps and NOT by row activity (a title
 * override does not touch `lastActivityAt`): the greatest per-row
 * `fetchSeq` — a monotonic client-side counter stamped at the commit
 * reducer on every inserted-or-updated row (rows the merge retained keep
 * their old stamps: the field lives on the row object and both carry paths
 * preserve it — the merge passes the same objects, and normalizeProjects
 * either passes references through or spreads `...session`). No existing
 * per-row field reflects fetch recency (`SessionDirectoryItem` carries only
 * activity times, shared/read-models.ts:51-86; `revision`/`snapshotSeq`
 * are page-level) — hence the client-side counter. Tie (e.g. both rows
 * unstamped → 0) → deterministic surface order (surfaces are
 * 'sidebar' | 'history' | 'bootstrap', sessionsThunks.ts:27).

 * finding 3): a TERMINAL pane mirrors IFF its content has NO terminalId
 * — a session-bound terminal pane with a valid sessionRef but no usable
 * terminalId (exited, unavailable, not-yet-reattached after rebuild) can't
 * receive inventory or live terminal-title events, so the directory row
 * is its only runtime title source — OR NO cached terminal-level title
 * exists for that terminalId: the replay cache holds only this window's
 * last-connection snapshot, so a terminal another client created after
 * this window's handshake never appears in it, no live terminal.title
 * event addresses the unopened pane, and terminal.attach.ready carries no
 * title — the blanket terminalId skip left such a pane on its derived
 * default forever. Once a cached terminal-level title exists, the
 * inventory fold/replay owns that pane's title (the registry-title
 * pipeline: server auto-title sweep, terminal renames via PATCH
 * /api/terminals/:id, the terminal.inventory fold, the live
 * terminal.title fold) — mirroring into it would undo a terminal rename
 * on every sessions/* commit; a terminal-level title that arrives LATER
 * (record → replay) overwrites the non-user-set mirror title exactly as
 * today. Fresh-agent panes keep matching unconditionally (their titles
 * have no registry pipeline). The mirror then dispatches PER-PANE
 * (updatePaneTitle, by tabId+paneId with the same user-set guard) for
 * exactly the pairs collected here, so the reducer can never over-reach
 * into a pane outside this target set (updatePaneTitleBySessionRef's
 * reducer deliberately matches both pane kinds via
 * paneContentMatchesSessionRef — e2r1 review finding 3); that shared
 * action keeps its all-kinds semantics for the session-rename cascade
 * (titleSync.ts:42). A pane whose user-set flag is true is NEVER a
 * target.
