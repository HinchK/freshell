// Pure geometry for the fresh-agent transcript minimap rail: maps measured
// user-turn landmarks (content coordinates) onto tick rects inside the rail,
// plus the band marking the currently visible region. Kept free of DOM and
// React so it is exhaustively unit-testable without jsdom geometry mocks.
//
// Placement is EVENLY SPACED: every prompt gets one uniform slot
// (railHeight / prompt count) regardless of where it sits in the
// transcript — the content offsets only order the prompts. A prompt's LINE
// height stays proportional to its turn's size (scale =
// railHeight / scrollHeight, floored at the density-thinned minimum, capped
// one pixel below the slot so adjacent lines keep a gap) and centers in its
// slot. Only the viewport band remains proportional to scroll position —
// it marks the real visible region of the content.
