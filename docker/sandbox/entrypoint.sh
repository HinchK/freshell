# --- dependency prep (fingerprinted, dual-manager) ------------------------

# both pnpm-era trees (packageManager pin; plan §7.3) and legacy npm-era
# branches (package-lock.json only), so the manager is selected per tree and
# the install is keyed by a fingerprint over the actual dependency inputs.
# The state file lives inside the install volume (node_modules is a named
# volume under scripts/sandbox-test.sh), so wiping the volume wipes the
# state. The old marker never satisfies this state: an npm-era volume, a
# stale marker, or a manager switch all trigger a fresh install.
